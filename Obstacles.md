# Julian-Personal-Health-Survey

During the classes of PHP, I was recovering from Covid so even though I was able to attend online lessons I wasn't able to concentrate at all. The next Tuesday from that, we had received these project instructions. 

It was a race of learning.

First to understand the requirements, later to understand the basics of PHP, create the structure, apply JS, and everything that comes into building a site. 

My main struggle (as I started to understand it) was, "how is it possible to save the info from the form to be able to use that later.

Now while I'm writing this I understood (or kind of) the concept of sessions so it is easy to learn where was my mistake.

Lucky for me I couldn't find my answer fast because that made me read a lot about the process, the session, GET, POST, COOKIES, and so on.

I am very happy about it.

Even though is always an opportunity to keep on learning, I improved my indentation in the code and work in an organized way.
