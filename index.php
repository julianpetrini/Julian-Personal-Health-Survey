Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.</p>

                <p class="card-text">
                Studies show getting quality sleep on a regular basis can help improve all sorts of issues, from your blood sugar to your workouts. When you're running low on sleep, you'll probably have trouble holding onto and recalling details. That's because sleep plays a big part in both learning and memory. Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to properly store memories so you can pull them up later.
                Sleep lets your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.
